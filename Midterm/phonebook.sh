Does the calculator need to be able to handle floating point/decimal numbers?

Ashwin AshokOct 8
Yes. But upto 1 decimal is fine

Kris SmallOct 9
how do you want us to utilize regex for the calculator? I feel that cases would work better or do we specifically need to find some way to incorporate regex?

OmarOct 11
Hello, Professor, you probably expected it. Is there a room for extension?

OmarOct 11
Or can we get penalized for each day we are late?

Andrew BullingtonOct 13
I kind need to know too.

Linux for my computer is literally too slow and i have tried to copy the code into a text editor in linux OS but it took 3 hours for that to even happen and it was on number 3. If you have any solutions for me please me know before the due time. Thank you
